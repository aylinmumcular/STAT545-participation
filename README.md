# STAT 545A-participation

Hi, this is my participation repository for STAT 545A. You can find the in-class activities I completed in each class meeting (14 meetings in total) under a separate folder. The codes in this repository are written in R/Rmd format and knitted to pdf, HTML, or md formats.

Enjoy!
